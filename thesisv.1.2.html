Today the web has faced designers with a new paradigm in which the prior reader has become the user —the person who experiences the web content; produces content as well as consumes it. Therefore the user experiences and intentionality has transcended more than ever meaning the graphic designer has to become the future innovator in order to affect the message.</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0 c3">The web initially is an immeasurable information space, meaning the web is about the content. While the interactivity feature of the web, has obscured the </span><span class="c0">relation</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;between the author and the content,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it has reinforced the engagement of the user and the content on the web; the user is constantly in a direct dialog with the content in forms of writing and reading. Therefore in the context of the web, any attempts from the designer in order to embrace the message has to be triggered within the content and how the user experiences the content through the interface.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0 c3">The term </span><span class="c0 c3 c4">content</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;might be too ambiguous to define yet finally it is a generic binary term which reveals itself as a </span><span class="c0 c3 c4">form</span><span class="c0 c3">.</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;This could possibly be physical &nbsp;- a box, a jar or a bottle, or a conventional form of media —a video, a show, an essay, tweet, a play or a novel</span><span class="c0 c3">. The most substantial point here is the complexity of web content which is posted in an behavioral environment . The content meaning is being augmented not only by the surrounding content but also by the metadatas integrated in it. Therefore the interpretation which is subordinate to user interaction is way more layered and complex and as well as the design process of it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0 c3">The complexity of web content and its design process has created an urgent towards a new alternatives in design. The new paradigm leaves to option rather than moving beyond all conventional equation about design and authorship. Whether </span><span class="c0 c3">designer as a faceless facilitator giving form to content created by an author or one who branches out to the foreign affairs of external politics and content, designer has to be innovative and conscious about the new possibilities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0 c3">In order to understand the equation between </span><span class="c0 c3 c4">designer</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c3 c4">content</span><span class="c0 c3">, let’s look at the variables. Considering the conventional notion, graphic design is a process of creating the communication which a message or idea is being communicated within. Therefore the designer is the one who aims to reach at the highest position within this hierarchy. The designer employs a series of techniques and skills in order to direct this process; determining how the message is projected. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0 c3">Authorship, one way or another, has been a popular term in graphic design circles. The word authorship has a ring of importance: it suggests agency, intention, and creation, as opposed to the more passive functions of consulting, styling, and formatting. But the exact meaning of designer-author , depends on how you define the term. I would suggest to see authorship as a floating &nbsp;position over the history of the mentioned context, carrying connotations such as responsibility, voice and action. Therefore when the designer tries to attain such position, we shall view the him/her as an author. No matter how the designer or author embraces or directs the content, it is the designed-content which yields the message . </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0 c3">To layout the conventional equation happening between the </span><span class="c0 c3 c4">designer</span><span class="c0 c3">, </span><span class="c0 c3 c4">content</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;and the position of &nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c3 c4">author</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;and to gain an understanding of the shift that has happened in regards to the very core of this equation; interpretation of the content. To comprehend the conception of what a content means and how it is interpreted, and also to outline the agency of design towards content production, I intend to employ a theoretical framework (as a means for my methodology) through which I study different phases of the content intentions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0 c3">This framework through which the variables of the mentioned equation get initialized and gain meaning, is structured on two important thinker/philosopher’s theories; Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes. In 1934, Benjamin, the German critic wrote </span><span class="c0 c3 c4">The Author as Producer</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;a text that assailed the conventional view of authorship as a pure literary enterprise. He outlines the relation between the new forms of communication and the borders between writing and reading, authoring and editing. Three decades later, Roland Barthes proposed the death of the author in an essay with the same title in 1968.

Benjamin expect the author and artists to revolutionise the meaning of the content flowing in content production chain. I use this idea which is still valuable today as an notion to evaluate the legitimacy and agency of design. The later theory by Barthes criticised the prestige of author as a figure by elevating the importance of inner functions of writing over the author’s intention; it is not important </span><span class="c0 c3 c4">what</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;it means but </span><span class="c0 c3 c4">how</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;it means.

The first theory which belongs to Roland Barthes outlines the position of the author regarding the new forms of media and doing so he asks the artists to add a voice and political act to their work. While later Walter Benjamin wrote an essay and ignored the position of the author; reasoning that no matter what the author intended to write, it is the reader who as the final destination of a text, merges multiple parts of a text and reveals the its intention. &nbsp;</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c14"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c17 c14 c11">2.1 The agency of the author</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c14"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">According to Benjamin and his Marxist ideologies, the ownership of technologies for manufacturing belong to workers. </span><span class="c0 c4">Means of production</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;lie at the heart of human culture and should be considered as public property.Educational institutes, publishers and writers producing and deliver text and raise literacy are the solid foundations for any society carrying various art forms including writing.

He expects the author, as a producer, to be inquisitive about the reader and the other contents which may be positioned with it. Who produces this content? He argues that photographers and artists should not reduce their work as merely visual consumer goods that can become an apparatus of </span><span class="highlight"><span class="c0">bourgeois</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;publishing.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup></span></p><h2 class="c7" id="h.sr5ijwkmfgzy"><span class="highlight"><span>“What we require of the photographer is the ability to give his picture the caption that wrenches it from modish commerce and gives it a revolutionary useful value.

To ensure this, the author as producer is in need of a revolutionary transfiguration and this requires challenging the concepts and norms of sources where literary masterpieces are produced. Therefore, at one point Benjamin expects the author to become a producer but not in a sense that he should be disguised as a factory worker, wearing a uniform and eventually becoming invisible. He expects artists and writers to </span><span class="c0">break down professional and economic barriers in the world of arts and literature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Furthermore Benjamin wrote </span><span class="highlight"><span class="c0">“</span><span class="c0 c4">Printing, having found in the book a refuge in which to lead an autonomous existence, is pitilessly dragged out onto the street by advertisements and subjected to the brutal heteronomy &nbsp;of economic chaos.

This has shifted the position of metadatas to the very core of a content by carrying part of a content semantic.

These analytical approaches </span><span class="c0">and such,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;generate a considerable part of the web content in the form of metadata legible for machines.

The videos on youtube vary for each visitor in order to </span><span class="c0">provide</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a better relevancy function. This relevancy is processed from either your browser cookies (as a placeholder for your browsing meditadas) or your watched history (only if you are logged in). As a result, each time you refresh the youtube page in your browser or on your phone application you see a different set of videos, not only newly added videos but also ones related to what you have recently watched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 title" id="h.o5zr178y4q8w"><span>3.5</span><span>&nbsp;Structuring the meaning: complex design Process </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c14"></span></p><h1 class="c7" id="h.t449vpifi9f5"><span>Whether the generative content is produced in explicit ways or is a result of the act of using and surfing a web-application’s success still hinges on just one thing: how users experience it. In order to evaluate and control this interactive experience we may need </span><span class="highlight"><span>User experience</span><sup><a href="#cmnt38" id="cmnt_ref38">[al]</a></sup></span><span>&nbsp;(abbreviated as UX); the UX is how a person feels when interfacing with a system. The system could be a website, a web application or a desktop software and in modern contexts is generally denoted by some form of </span><span class="highlight"><span>human-computer interaction (HCI)</span><span>. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt39" id="cmnt_ref39">[am]</a></sup></span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Nowadays, with so much emphasis on user-centered design, it seems there is no need to glorify the importance of UX design. However back in the days (prior to the codification of user-centered design, usability and Web accessibility) designers made design decisions based only on both their attitudes and design terminologies and clients desires. As Jacob Gube explains </span><span class="c0">“</span><span class="highlight"><span class="c0 c4">The focus was on aesthetics and the brand, with little to no thought of how the people who would use the website would feel about it</span><span class="c0">.”</span><sup><a href="#cmnt40" id="cmnt_ref40">[an]</a></sup></span><span class="c0"><br></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">From a different point of view the UX has become a point of value when the web 2.0 and other benchmarks in web technology changed the way we perceive the web content. These technologies have changed the nature of the web content; the interactive structure of the web on one hand and the content on other hand, seem to be inseparable. The deep integration of these two parts results in a new paradigm about the way we read, consume or as I discussed earlier the way we produce information. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">The web content originally is a hypertext per se. T</span><span class="c0">he </span><span class="highlight"><span class="c0">flexibility of hypertext </span><sup><a href="#cmnt41" id="cmnt_ref41">[ao]</a></sup></span><span class="c0">as the haven of the written text neglects to consider the very meaning and intention that comes from surrendering to the discursive seductions of a masterful author. The real nature of hypertext gives indefinite possibilities through dynamic links and wide path choices of free ways of directing, controlling and surprising the reader more than ever. Therefore the reader has more freedom interpreting the content on the screen which reconfirms the idea of </span><span class="c0 c4">The Death of the Author</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">T</span><span class="c0">he new content is not simply a single text or image or even multiform content but it is interactive and more importantly located within a behavioral environment. It is surrounded by other different types of content: moving images, hyperlinks, ads, etc. Hence the behavioral environment in which the content is posted will reflect on the original content. The user </span><span class="c0">has many immediate accessibilities to resources —such as wikis, tags, comments, reviews , etc— to evaluate and presume a content . Having said this surrounding content is not the only factor affecting the interpretation but metadatas also play a pivotal role.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Let us explore</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the representation of content on twitter; a tweet contains a piece of text originated by a user (author) and the metadatas attached to it. The metadata of this tweet adds a layer of interpretation to the simple text. So there are two components in form of a tweet which affect its interpretation. These metadatas such as likes and comments listed below the tweet could be effected by assigning a new perspective and prejudgment interest to the tweet text. In that way metadata would affect the reader's interpretation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Therefore the web content does not have an individual spirit inherited only by its author or designer neither by the users interaction itself.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;In the context of dynamic and behavioral web environment, the content interpretation is </span><span class="c0">augmented by </span><span class="c0">the metadata and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;surrounding content</span><span class="c0">. Although both augmented components are initially passive; meaning that they come alive through user interaction —such as clicking or posting a comment. Therefore augmented perception is being added, extended and developed on behalf of the user (primary reader). Hence </span><span class="c0">neither the author nor the designer have no exact perception of this </span><span class="c0">augmented meaning and its quality</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">So in our classic equation, the user intentionality which reveals itself in the form of user interaction has become more important than ever. However the interactivity of the web can be seen as the modern implementation of &nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4">The Death of the Author</span><span class="c0">, this new paradigm has more aspects to it by obscuring the line between the author and the content. Clearly, the web boosts up the enthusiasm about self-expression and self publishing and therefore the number of authors. Besides that, the web has dramatically declined the effort and time factors of publishing, thus it comes as no surprise that there is also an enormous shift about re-publishing the pre-authorised contents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">The less effort required to publish a content on the web the more chance of &nbsp;the content being garbled, readjusted and edited into different versions —e.g: viral videos and their different versions being made, </span><span class="highlight"><span class="c0">hype images</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and internet memes</span><sup><a href="#cmnt42" id="cmnt_ref42">[ap]</a></sup></span><span class="c0 c3 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">and etc. The augmented meaning applied to the original content can sometimes place the user in the position of the original author; For example some metadatas (in forms of features) such as </span><span class="c0 c4">retweet</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;enable the users to re-publish a tweet just by one click. But sometimes it can also be readjusted and added back to the cycle. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">The immense number of authors on the web is corroding the borders between the author and the content, and any act of re editing only further muddies the water. As the relation of author and the content has become vague and insignificant, the relation of the user and content has become clear which elevates the user importance. Therefore locating the designer in the context of what &nbsp;Benjamin expects from artists —revolutionising the meaning of the text— leads the designer to embrace user intentionality. But as the content has become more layered, the factors involving content interpretation have become more complex. </span><span class="c0">Considering this, </span><span class="c0 c4">using</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as a process consists of multiple behaviours such as: surfing and searching, reading (consuming) and writing (explicit way of production). This multiplicity notion of </span><span class="c0 c4">using</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;turns it into a layered and complex process and therefore its design becomes a very complex task which requires collaboration of different fields of expertise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Design process on the web is not only on hands of a graphic designer, but it is a collaborative design process. This collaboration includes back-end development, front-end development and depends on </span><span class="c0">the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;scale </span><span class="c0">of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;UX design or front-end design; a combination of programming, design and human-computer interaction. </span><span class="c0">Having mentioned the above</span><span class="c0">, the question is how </span><span class="c0">does a</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; graphic designer take place within this new paradigm? How can a designer embrace the design message while this process has become so complex.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 title" id="h.jnj32gzh6pcq"><span>4.

The complexity of designing, such &nbsp;interactivity, has left a small part for graphic design (in its conventional notion) to be effective in what the design will communicate thus </span><span class="c3">the graphic designer has to become the innovator in order to affect the message. </span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c7 title" id="h.qe8mix8wocz"><span class="c14">4.1 </span><span class="highlight"><span class="c14">Designer as a director</span><sup><a href="#cmnt43" id="cmnt_ref43">[aq]</a></sup></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Movies are a very good example of collaborative tasks in which the director leads all different areas of production. While being a director empowers you to have control on the narrative, form, sound etc, you are able to have an overview of its entire landscape. Therefore a designer at his very best position could be seen as a director; a director who designs a system which different professions collaborate together in order to make the final design based on what the designers idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Being a director requires having a plan and an idea. This plan can only be comprehensive and effective if you are aware of the possibilities of the different require expertise —as a director is aware of possibilities in cinematography, scripting, acting and etc. Therefore a graphic designer needs to be aware of possibilities given by his/her tools; Programing, UX design and etc. On other hand the rapid development of technology, tools and their complexity is becoming more and more simple and less require a specific profession. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Having an eye to the future, enlightens a path in which the design process and its tools become simple to use and the graphic designer can master. In such future being a director as a designer, means being a director of tools although in that sense there is a crucial point where the same technology would be accessible for people of all interests. Such a technology can place people in direct dialogue with typography, photography and other visual elements traditionally associated with graphic design suggesting that we might also dabble as citizen designers while blogging, chatting, uploading and posting our way to a new social paradigm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">The challenge of being effective is still on.

This embracement can be revealed in different forms; it can affect the place where content is located in a visual way, or it can be textual. The implication of this model in reality would be an autonomous designed content which is detached from the environment it will be placed within. This independency requires the content to be armed by a built in design framework &nbsp;therefore making it easier for the designer to apply his/her thoughts in the design process.</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">In order to demonstrate the idea I would ask you to think about an article which is published on a online platform. The major aim of what I call built in design would be a readjustment to the the page where the article is being shown. One of these changes can be for example hiding the unrelated hyperlinks, images, ads, etc in the surrounding as well as emphasising on the related contents. If I as a designer of the article consider a pure and neutral design for it, I would expect the article to be shown in a pure and natural designed environment, so the built in design feature could change the color range of all the elements into a limited range of color, and reduce the diversity of typographical elements. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Finally when I am talking about a built in design, I am actually talking about a feature like metadata which is being built in a content.
