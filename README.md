Design as Metadata

by Amir Houieh
Graphic Design Bachelor Thesis/ 2016


Abstract:
Today the web has faced designers with a new paradigm in which the prior reader has become the user â€”the person who experiences the web content; produces content as well as consumes it. Therefore the user experiences and intentionality has transcended more than ever meaning the graphic designer has to become the future innovator in order to affect the message. Hence within my thesis in order to reflect upon the agency of the designer in contents of the web future; I propose an idea about implementation of design within the content as a metadata.
